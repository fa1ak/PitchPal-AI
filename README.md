### Example Screenshots

Below are screenshots demonstrating the response handling and conversation stages of PitchPal-AI in action, showcasing the transition between different stages of customer interaction and how the agent handles user input:

1. **Initial Pricing Inquiry**:
   - The user asks about prices for bathroom products.
   - The agent responds by providing clear price details and transitioning into the conversation close stage, asking if the user would be interested in further engagement, such as placing an order or scheduling a follow-up.
